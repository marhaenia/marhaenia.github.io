			<h2>Laws on Asset Management and Regional Autonomy Officially Promulgated</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The People's Assembly has officially enacted two laws that have significant impacts on administration, development, and regional autonomy. Law of the Socialist Republic of Marhaenia Number 4 of 2023 on the Management of Assets of Provinces Removed from the Territory of the Socialist Republic of Marhaenia and the Law of the Socialist Republic of Marhaenia Number 5 of 2023 on the Regional Autonomy of New Territories are now integral parts of Marhaenia's legal framework.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h3>Law of the Socialist Republic of Marhaenia Number 4 of 2023 on the Management of Assets of Provinces Removed from the Territory of the Socialist Republic of Marhaenia</h3>
      <p>In a step marking changes in the territory of the Socialist Republic of Marhaenia, Law Number 4 of 2023 regulates the management of assets related to the provinces that have been removed from the country's territory. Hamington, Skolaf, and Lanangrad are no longer within Marhaenia's scope, and this law establishes guidelines on how these assets will be managed, including inventory, assessment, and the utilization of proceeds from asset sales.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</>
      <h3>Law of the Socialist Republic of Marhaenia Number 5 of 2023 on the Regional Autonomy of New Territories</h3>
      <p>The People's Assembly has also taken a significant step in granting autonomy to the new territories that have been added to the Socialist Republic of Marhaenia. Law Number 5 of 2023 outlines the rights and responsibilities of the local governments in Vlanderming, Volkstad, Leninsky, Aidigrad, and Vraada. This autonomy covers various aspects, ranging from governance to the management of natural resources and culture, with the central government retaining supervisory responsibilities.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Both laws reaffirm Marhaenia's commitment to sustainable development and policy equity across all regions. In his official address, President Marhaen emphasized the importance of collaboration between the central and regional governments in implementing these laws.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>With the promulgation of these two laws, Marhaenia is moving forward to create a new order that is more efficient, sustainable, and just in national administration and development.</p>
