the Act of Friendship bestowed upon our nation. We are honored by the conferral of
the rank of Grand Officer of the Order of the Star of Merit of Egemonica upon
President A. M. Marhaen.</p>
        <p>We share your hope that the Workers' Party of Marhaenia and the Egemonican Party
can forge a collaborative relationship, working together to advance the interests and
well-being of both our micronations. Cooperation and the exchange of ideas
between our governments hold great promise for the future.</p>
        <p>We deeply appreciate your offer of assistance in overcoming any future challenges
that may arise. Your support demonstrates the genuine spirit of friendship and
solidarity between our nations. We also eagerly anticipate the presentation of the
new emblem for our ruling party, which will serve as a symbolic representation of
our strengthened ties.</p>

the Kingdom of Egemonica.</p>
